First University program in CUDA/C++ to sum up cell values in an area of cells.

Allows to change the size of the matrix (n), the area within which cells are to be summed up (r), size of the block for the GPU to process (blockWidth, later multiplied to blockWidth*blockWidth), how many calculations to do per thread (k)
